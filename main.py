'''
write a function that is provided as input the path to a grayscale image; the function finds all the horizontal gray lines in the image (the image background is black) and returns a list of tuples (color, length) for each line found in the image, in which "color" is the (R, G, B) tuple representing the color of a line and "length" is the corresponding length; tuples must be sorted from the longest line to the shortest one, and, if several lines have the same length, by color intensity, from the brightest to the darkest.
